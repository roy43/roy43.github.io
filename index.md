Hello! I am Cuong Nguyen, an engineer and a data scientist. I was born and raised in the Southwest Vietnam. 

I am currently pursuing my PhD at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) in Australia and expecting to confer my degree in May, 2021.


My research focuses on two main streams including (1) traffic control and management in transportation networks considering Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and (2) deep learning applications in traffic management using imagery data. More details on my research can be found in [Research](https://phucuong.me/research) page.


My hobbies are pretty simple. I love travelling, cooking and drinking in my free time. I've put my footsteps on three continents and my utmost dream is to finish the rest before my 30. Pieces of me can be found [here](https://phucuong.me/blog).
